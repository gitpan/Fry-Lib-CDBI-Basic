Description
	These are Class::DBI libraries that plug into Fry::Shell.
Features
	- Contains functions that search with &Class::DBI::search* and
	Class::DBI::AbstractSearch:search_where, delete, search and replace in records with a perl regexp, update
	records via a text editor and insert. Also has a few functions used to manipulate DBI::Profile's
	logging.
	- Can define print modes for queries with &_alias_print
	- Most functions can have their actions confined to certain columns via the 'c' option.
ToDo
	-defining relations between tables but first need to get design to work with Class::DBI::Loader
	-provide direct SQL queries
	-support shell-like parsing of quotes to allow spaces in queries
	-specify sorting and limit of queries
	-embed sql or database functions in queries
	-create an easily-parsable syntax for piecing chunks into 'or' and 'and' parts
		to be passed to Class::DBI::AbstractSearch
